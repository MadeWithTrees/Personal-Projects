# Personal-Projects

A list of my personal projects.

For now, I'm working on two projects.

The first one involves use of an arduino kit to program a servo on a television screen.

The second one is essentially a text story I'd like to create. It's a bunch of print statements which will then allow the user to make their choice. Based on that choice, the question prompts change and so forth, and this goes on indefinitely.
